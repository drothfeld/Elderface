# Elderface
IOS Application (iPad)

Version 1.0.0 (Assignment Submitted)

**Description:**
- A mobile application being developed for the CMPM 290K course at UC Santa Cruz. The goal of this project is to design a mobile interface that senior citizens find intuitive to interact with. Specifically, this application focuses on the user designing their own interface that is intuitive to them personally. This application is a prototype proof of concept to test if users find such an interface intuitive. This concept (properly implemented) could be used to design a user-specific custom interface for any application, instead of the user being at the mercy of the designers. Further testing on senior citizen users is required to know whether this proof of concept has any potential in the real-world.

**Known Bugs:**
- complete_slow.wav does not play on ElderfaceViewController after correctly selecting the slow audio speed (complete_normal.wav is played instead).
- After restarting the demo VIA the given restart button on ElderfaceViewController, the <Tap Anywhere> UILabel does not run its blinking animation.

**Features Still Needed:**
- Built-In feedback system of demo performance after completion.
- More interface customizability categories.
- Example application implementation utilizing custom Elderface menu.
